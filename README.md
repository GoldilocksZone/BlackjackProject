# BlackjackProject
# Description
## This project seeks to simulate a blackjack table, with a dealer, players, and betting. It focuses heavily on object oriented programming, pushing as much functionality to dedicated methods within very specific classes.
## When the program begins, the user is asked to select the number of players that will join the table. Players place their bets, and then the dealer deals two cards to each player as well as to itself.
## Players are subsequently given the option to split, double down, stay, or surrender. After the player has made their choice, the dealer follows very specific rules (common to all blackjack games) to arrive at its final hand.
## Finally, scores are reconciled, bets are paid out, and the user is given the chance to play again or quit.
# Technologies Used
## Java, Eclipse, and a little bit of Papyrus for creating UML diagrams.
# Lessons Learned
## I came to understand even better the complexity of software design. I spend considerable time trying to establish the architecture of the program before coding. This was an invaluable practice that taught me, among many other things, that good design relies heavily on a strong understanding of both the problem and the language we are using to solve it. Ultimately, my understanding of Java proved still too basic to prepare a clean and functional design in advance, which left me to do a significant portion of the design simultaneously with coding.
